# Intro

Cryptographic devices are implemented using semiconductor logic gates (Not exactly FPGA, but a starting point), which are constructed from transistors.
Electrons flow across the silicon substrate when a charge is applied to (or removed from) a transistor's gate, consuming power and producing electromagnetic radiation.

Using a shunt resistor in series with power or ground input, this power consumption can be measured in analog to the current as $\frac{V}{R}=I$. 

Thus we may obtain a [[trace]], measuring the current over time - capturing a cryptographic operation.
